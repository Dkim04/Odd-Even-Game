# Odd Even Game

**Overview**

This project implements a simple game called "Odds and Evens". In this game two players choose to show between 0-5 fingers; if the sum is even, the player who predicted "even wins" and vice versa if the sum is odd. Here, a human player competes against an AI, named HAL-9000. The game combines elements of chance and psychology, as the AI attempts to learn and predict the human player's moves depending on the difficulty levvel chosen.
